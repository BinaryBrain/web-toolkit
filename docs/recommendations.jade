    Please note that these recommendations are a working draft.

  table.table--docs
    tbody
      tr#viewport
        td viewport meta tag
        td
          p.
            We recommend using the following meta tag:

          pre.highlight.hljs: code.html
            :highlight
              <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">

          p.
            The <code>width=device-width</code> forces the browsers viewport to have a width that equals the device width. The device width means the width in CSS pixels not in device pixels. This means that normalization is already done. The width for an iPhone (1136 * 640 @ 2x) in portrait mode would be 320px.

          p.
            The <code>minimum-scale=1.0</code> and <code>maximum-scale=1.0</code> force the browser to start at zoom 1.0 and disable pinch'n'zoom. This will provide the most "native-app-like" experience.

          p.
            If you'd like to enable pinch'n'zoom you can replace the min and max scale with an <code>initial-scale=1.0</code>.

          p.
            Find more information on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag" >Mozilla Developer Network</a> or on the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports2.html" >Blog of Peter Paul Koch</a>.

      tr#x-ua-compatible
        td X-UA-Compatible
        td
          p.
            We recommend using a X-UA-Compatible meta tag with the content <code>"IE=edge"</code>. This forced the Internet Explorer to not use any compatibiliy modes.

          p.
            This is required because there are some preferences on the internal Internet Explorer package to fall into compatibility mode on intranet sites as a default. Furthermore invalid markup (HTML5 may be considered invalid in older versions of IE) will result in compatibility mode.

          pre.highlight.hljs: code.html
            :highlight
              <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

      tr#charset
        td charset
        td
          p.
            We recommend the utf-8 charset since it is a defacto standard and we're operating in a multilingual country in an international group.

          pre.highlight.hljs: code.html
            :highlight
              <meta charset="utf-8">

          p.callout.callout--danger.
            Be aware that your server has to deliver the HTML encoded in the character set specified.

      tr#less
        td LESS Compiler
        td
          p.
            Whenever you get in touch with LESS CSS we recommend using the official LESS compiler (or plugins using this compiler) available at <a href="http://lesscss.org" >lesscss.org</a>. This compiler is proved to work with the LESS CSS specification and this style guide is based on it.

          p.callout.
            At some points less might not be enough. If you need further templating logic in less files (have a look at our icons.less.lodash file) we recommend using lodash or something similar.
