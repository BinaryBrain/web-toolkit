  A radio button is a basic control that enables the user to make a single selection from just a few options. This component is <b>not to be used</b> due to its limitations on mobile devices. See [Segmented Control](/components/form-and-imput-elements/segmented-control.html) or [Dropdown](/components/form-and-imput-elements/dropdown.html) as alternatives.

p.paragraph.
  Radio Buttons are only used as a backup solution for segmented controls.
