#Single Page Applications
##Search Enginge Optimization

##Browser Back Button

##Instant Feedback
Every actions creates a reaction. Users always need to know if the system is working properly.
###Load Spinners
Load spinners tell a user that the site is working / loading / rendering or any other action. AXA created a custom spinner which should be used whenever a delay is possible. The text in front of the spinner should be adapted to the action happening. A generic "loading" may not always be the best solution.

##Animations
Moving elements are a powerful tool to attract and or waste users’ attention. When designing an animation consider its goal, its frequency of occurrence, and its mechanics.
Employ them sparingly and only when they add meaning to the interaction. Think about whether the animation will cause an attention shift or not and whether the same user is likely to stumble over it again and again. Will the animation reinforce relationships between UI elements? Will users trigger it directly or not? All these aspects matter in the design of a successful animation.

>Checklist Animation
- For an animation to effectively convey a cause-and-effect relationship between UI elements, the effect must begin within 0.1 seconds of the initial user action. This 0.1-second response time maintains the feeling of direct manipulation and supports the perception that the user action caused the new element to appear.
- Slower transitions are less likely to cause an attention shift and are thus less distracting. They are appropriate for animations indirectly triggered by the user or not user initiated in any way. In these situations, the new element should appear with little or no change in position to minimize distraction.
- Fast animations are more likely to attract attention when they happen outside the user’s focus of attention. They are suitable for important elements that users must attend to and act upon.
