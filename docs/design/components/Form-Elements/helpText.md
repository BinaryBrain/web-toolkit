#Help Text

Help text can be provided to help users fill in the form and to clear up questions. Still, donâ€™t use labels to fix shortcomings of bad form design or unclear label text. 

>Checklist: Help Text
- Avoid help texts wherever and whenever possible.
- Use it to explain unfamiliar data or why the question is asked at all.
- Help text is always placed outside the input field and never inside.
- Unless you have a lot of help text, use an inline system. This avoid page-jumping and rollover problems.
- Triggers for user-activated help text should be placed next to labels and not input fields.
