#Honeypot

Honeypots are hidden form fields that trap spam robots because those robots can't distinguish between shown and hidden form fields. Therefore, a robot will fill the field and therefore fail the test. *Nevertheless* this field should have a clear label which tells users with screen readers to not fill this form.

#Timestamps
If honeypots are not enough to stop spammers, consider to measure the time a user needs to fill in the form. If a user requires less than (for example!) 10 seconds to fill 5 fields, it's probably a spam-robot. This technique should be carefully implemented and take prefilling into account, since this can massively speed up a users data entrance.
