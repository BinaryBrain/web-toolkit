title: Segmented Control
template: design.jade

A **segmented** is a basic control that enables the user to make a single selection from just a few options. A single tab or click enables the user to choose a value. Default values can be set if appropriate - if in doubt, do not set defaults.

Do not use a segmented control if the user has to choose from many different options. In this case, use a [dropdown element](#) or a grid view. Also, if texts are unavoidably to long for a segmented control, [radio buttons](#) may also be used as an alternative.
