#Action-Buttons

Primary actions bring people closer to completion, secondary actions allow them to go back. Make it clear to the user what happens after he clicks / taps a button. Placement and behaviour of buttons should avoid mistakes.

>Checklist: Action Buttons
- Give primary actions the highest colour-contrast of all actions.
- Avoid secondary actions whenever possible. If you have them, distinguish them visually.
- Previous always stays left of next
- Group actions & Align primary actions with input-fields to prevent mistakes
- When a form is being processed, disable the action-button to prevent multiple clicks & errors
- For actions like reset or clear, provide people with an easy way to undo it
- Combine agreement-checkboxes with Buttons to reduce one step from the process
- Always set a useful label, to let the user know what will happen next
