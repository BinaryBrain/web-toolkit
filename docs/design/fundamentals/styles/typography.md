Contrast in type sizes can go a long way to create ordered, understandable layouts. However, too many different sizes in the same UI can be messy.

These are the typography styles for all AXA Webapplications:

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
